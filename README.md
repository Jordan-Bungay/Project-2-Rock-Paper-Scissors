# Rock, Paper and Scissors game

I have created this rock, paper and scissors game to show my ability to work with html, css and javascript.

Rock, paper and scissors is a game mainly based on luck, you will be given 3 options to choose from to fight against the computer. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper and Paper beats Rock.

This game will allow interactivity with the page to click on your options in the game.
